# Investigate a Dataset (No Show Appointments DataSet)


## Summary

For this project, I conducted my own data analysis and created a file to share that documents my findings. I start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions could be answered using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.


### Describtion 

I used the No-show appoinments data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website (available in a Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True)), where you can find some informations about the data.

* **Data Wrangling** I started with choosing the No-show appoinments data, then made some cleaning to it. 

* **Analyse the Data**  Brainstorm some questions that I could answer using the data set, then started answering those questions. 
The first question which came to my mind, and thought it would be interesting to answer is 'Does the age of the a patients have an effect on showing to his appointment or not?'. Tried suggesting questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables.
